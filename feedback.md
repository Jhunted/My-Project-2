#### Feedback:  

Joseph, excellent job bringing everything together. You should be proud of this application that you built. I know you wanted built something more practical, however what you built here is a clear and precise demonstration of your skills as a developer. This app will look great in any portfolio to show employeers you know what you are doing.

I do have some feedback for you. First, I do suggest flipping the title, and navigation elements placement. Its counter intuitive and does feel askew. Also I would suggest reworking the forms to be stacked on top of one another. They would need to take up more width as well. 

Be sure to keep your head up, and bring a great attidude where ever you go. Especially during a presentation. If you are not excited about a product, no one will be. Otherwise great job, and keep up the work. Be sure to get some practice building API servers when you can during the Python/ Django lessons. Also change the name from project two, to the name of your app.
